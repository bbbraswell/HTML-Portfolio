<h3>Stranger Than Paradise</h3>
<p>A movie directed by Jim Jarmusch. A bit slow and mundane, but entertaining.</p>
<h3>Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman</h3>
<p>An animated film based on short stories by Haruki Murakami. It weaves some short stories and his novel The Wind Up Bird Chronicle into one movie. Just like his stories, it shows strange and surreal elements breaking into the lives of ordinary Japanese people.</p>
<h3>Face Off</h3>
<p>A 90's Hollywood action movie directed by John Woo, starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. Like Woo's Hong Kong action movies, it features super cops and super criminals flipping around and shooting eachother in engaging and inventive action sequences. There are also doves. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that outside of the action scenes, it's tough to sit through. Nic Cage and Travolta keep it entertaining, but without them, it would be even harder to watch. </p>
